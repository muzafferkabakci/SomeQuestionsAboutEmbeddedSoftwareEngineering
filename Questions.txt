1. What are the main features of Real-Time Operating Systems and how do they differ from regular OSâ€™s?
2. When is it preferable to use STM32 over Arduino, ESP32, PIC or other comparable embedded system?
3. Let's assume that a few of the peripherals you use have the same hardcoded I2C address. What solution would you use to solve this problem?
4. Let's assume that there is a hardware module that is attached to the motherboard with a mezzanine connector. Due to the small form factor, the number of pins on the mezzanine connector is much less than the number of pins you need. Assuming that the communication speed is not important, how would you solve this problem?
5. Let's say you want about 30 hardware modules to communicate with each other. There is one STM32 microcontroller on each module, and the modules can be removed and installed instantly. Which communication standard would you use for these modules to communicate effectively with each other? Why?
6. 3 devices with identical embedded software and hardware are required to communicate over I2C. What kind of solution would you develop so that devices can be dynamically addressed and recognize each other?
